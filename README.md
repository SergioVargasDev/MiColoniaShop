# MiColoniaShop
MiColoniaShop is a web platform tailored to empower local grocery stores and small businesses during challenging times, like the COVID-19 pandemic. It simplifies shopping for neighborhood products, promoting local business sustainability and user convenience.

In the wake of COVID-19, the local grocery sector faced significant hardships, with about 45% of stores closing and a 25% revenue decline. MiColoniaShop responds to this crisis by offering an online platform for these stores to continue operations, aiming to significantly reduce the closure rate and financial downturn. The implementation of MiColoniaShop is projected to not only halt but potentially reverse these negative trends, offering a lifeline to struggling local businesses.
